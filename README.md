_**By Rosemary Ojwang**_

*An application that connects landlords with tenants.*

## Technologies Used

* HTML

## Description
*The application allows landlords to sign up, login, and post houses for potential tenants to view. The landlords are also able to view all the houses they've posted, modify the house details, and even delete the houses from the site if need be. They can also logout once they are done.*

*Potential tenants can view the details of the houses, and contact the landlords for physical house viewing, and maybe proceed to rent the houses.*  

## Known Bugs
